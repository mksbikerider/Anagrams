# Simple Anagram REST service

Sample code for finding anagrams in a word list.

The code to find the Anagrams is simplistic and lacks unit tests as the code is not complex enough to require it.

The gradle configuration is useful as it is a working example of JUnit5, Spring-boot-starter-web and spring-restdocs.
This gives an integration test platform for REST applications and automatically produces the documentation.
